/*
Usage of Anonymous Objects in Operator Overloading
When we have created two anonymous objects. These 
    objects donâ€™t contribute much their only function 
    is to perform the operation and transfer the result 
    into a normal object. If we want to refer to the 
    objects after the implementation of the statement, 
    then in such cases we can create the normal object 
    but, when we are not referring to the object anymore 
    in that case it is better to use anonymous objects.
