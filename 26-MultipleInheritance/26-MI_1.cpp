/*
Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.  
The constructors of inherited classes are called in the same order in which they are inherited. 
A class can be derived from more than one base class.
Eg: 
(i) A CHILD class is derived from FATHER and MOTHER class
(ii) A PETROL class is derived from LIQUID and FUEL class.
